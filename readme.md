# Real time chat with Javascript

We are going to make a real time chat with Javascript in this free workshop. You will learn websockets and the basics of Node.js.

You will receive a basic Node.js template and we will follow the project from there. We will then implement the front-end with simple CSS+HTML, and finally we will add the real time functionality with javascript, socket.io and jQuery.

Thanks to Hiroaki Yasutomo for hosting this event at SHIFTBRAIN Inc. He also organizes these awesome weekly programming meetups: https://www.meetup.com/i-teach-you-programming-so-you-teach-me-english/
